# ScreenMatch Front-end

This is the front-end application for the ScreenMatch project, developed during the **Avanzando con Java** training from Alura.

Developed by [Monica Hillman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monicamhillman/).

## Getting Started

To run the application:

1. Download it as a ZIP file or clone the repository.
2. Open it in VS Code.
3. Install the *Live Server* extension.
4. Right-click on the **index.html** file and choose "Open with Live Server".

Initially, as the API was being developed, you might have seen content like this:

Now that the course is completed, your project should be fully functional, with registered series and an API with all the necessary routes. The application will now display data like this:
